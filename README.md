ML covering both supervised and unsupervised algorithms

linear_regression_coefficients.py: illustrates calculating coefficients (betas) using Least Square, Gradient Descent and Ridge Regresion.  This is implemented in Python
Usage: python linear_regression_coefficients.py
Output: This program will print the coefficients with each logic: Gradient Descent, LS and Ridge
